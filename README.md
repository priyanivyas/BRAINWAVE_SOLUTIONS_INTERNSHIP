# **Sales Analysis - Laptop Dataset**

This is my first task at my internship! I was given a sales dataset to analyze and create insights from it. I decided to focus on laptop sales data since it's something I'm genuinely interested in.

## What this project is about

I'm working with a laptop sales dataset to understand buying patterns, popular products, and sales trends. The goal was to dig into the data and find meaningful insights that could help with business decisions.

## My approach

Since this is my first real data analysis project at the company, I wanted to be thorough:

- Cleaned and explored the laptop sales data
- Looked for trends in sales by month, time of day, and product categories  
- Created visualizations to make the data easier to understand
- Built a Power BI dashboard to present my findings

## What I found interesting

Some cool patterns emerged from the data:
- **Seasonal trends**: Certain months show way higher laptop sales (probably back-to-school and holiday seasons)
- **Time patterns**: There are specific hours when people buy laptops more frequently
- **Product preferences**: Some laptop models clearly dominate sales
- **Price vs demand**: Interesting relationship between pricing and purchase volume

## Tools I used

- **Excel**: For initial data cleaning and exploration
- **Power BI**: Created an interactive dashboard to visualize insights
- **Dataset source**: Got the data from Kaggle

## Power BI Dashboard

I put together a dashboard that shows:
- Monthly sales breakdown
- Sales patterns throughout the day
- Top-performing laptop models
- Revenue trends over time

The dashboard is interactive, so you can filter by different time periods and product categories to explore the data yourself.

## Dataset details

The laptop sales dataset includes:
- Individual transaction records
- Product information (models, specs, prices)
- Purchase dates and times
- Customer data
- Sales quantities and revenue

## What I learned

This being my first internship task, I learned a ton:
- How to approach a real business dataset
- The importance of data cleaning (way more time-consuming than I expected!)
- How to tell a story with data visualizations
- Power BI is pretty powerful once you get the hang of it

## Why laptops?

I chose to focus on laptop data because:
1. It's a product category I understand well
2. Laptop sales have interesting seasonal patterns
3. There's enough variety in models/specs to make the analysis interesting
4. The price range allows for good revenue analysis

This project really opened my eyes to how much insight you can extract from sales data. Looking forward to diving deeper into data analysis in my next tasks!

Feel free to check out the dashboard and let me know what you think. Always open to feedback as I'm still learning!
